         So, I am Aybarinee Campbell Mendez. I am from Gracias A Dios, Honduras. I was born and raised there up until I was 10 or 11 years 
         old when I moved to Jamaica. Now you may be wondering how did I end up in jamaica? You may have questions and questions haha!.
          Well, my Father is Jamaican ! I came here without knowing English, the culture shock was not as difficult because my father knows my languages. 
         My big brother prince would normally try his very best to cook jamaican food as simple as possible for me to eat. I am blessed to me surrounded by 
         genuine family members that always made me feel at home and loved. I was born on the 30th of March 2001. However, my mother registered me with the wrong 
         DOB. So, my legal birthday is April 3, 2001. I find it so funny! lol! Another thing, English is my third language but people would never know because me can chat 
         patwa like wah real yawdie ! I love Jamaican culture and their language! I study software Engineer, I love web development! I pray to get very well at everything 
         I do. </p>

                Since we are getting to know each other via this blog page, I thought that It would be crucial to mention a moment in my life that has changed my future and whole perspective of life. 
                So, I grew up in a non-christian home. I never truly knew God nor did I have any idea of the things concerning Him. I just know that I could never be the type that goes to
                 church because I always thought of christians as one of the most hypocritical beings on earth. I mean, I just never truly cared about heaven or hell, I never cared about whether or 
                 not I have God in my life. I never saw the need for Him in my life. I knew nothing about Him. Then as the years passed by, the tables turned lol! I experienced God for myself, 
                 I experienced His love and His grace in such an intimate manner that I decided to dedicate my life to Him. His love overwhelmed me in such an undescribable way that I never wanted to go on with my life without it.
                 I love Him, I love His people and my prayer is that people may encounter Him for themselves! for people to know and serve God and know that He loves them before the foundation of this world.
